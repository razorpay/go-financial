/*
This package is a go native port of the numpy-financial package with some additional helper
functions.

The functions in this package are a scalar version of their vectorised counterparts in
the numpy-financial(https://github.com/numpy/numpy-financial) library.

Currently, only some functions are ported, the remaining will be ported soon.

/*
Pmt compute the fixed payment(principal + interest) against a loan amount ( fv = 0).

It can also be used to calculate the recurring payments needed to achieve a certain future value
given an initial deposit, a fixed periodically compounded interest rate, and the total number of periods.

It is obtained by solving the following equation:

	fv + pv*(1 + rate)**nper + pmt*(1 + rate*when)/rate*((1 + rate)**nper - 1) == 0

Params:
 rate	: rate of interest compounded once per period
 nper	: total number of periods to be compounded for
 pv	: present value (e.g., an amount borrowed)
 fv	: future value (e.g., 0)
 when	: specification of whether payment is made
	  at the beginning (when = 1) or the end
	  (when = 0) of each period
